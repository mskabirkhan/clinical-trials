- Patient Reported Outcomes",No,"Master Protocol:

Patients are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria apply (as well as all criteria from the appropriate candidate-specific trial protocol): 
1. Adults (≥18 years) with laboratory-confirmed* SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR)
2. Ability to provide informed consent signed by study patient or legally acceptable representative
3. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and male patients who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception from the first administration of trial treatment, throughout trial treatment and for the duration outlined in the candidate-specific trial protocol after the last dose of trial treatment
*If any CSTs are included in the community setting, the CST protocol will clarify whether patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection are also eligible. 

Standard additional criteria that may be applied per candidate-specific trial protocol:

Group A (severe disease)
Patients with clinical status of Grades 5 (hospitalised, oxygen by mask or nasal prongs), 6 (hospitalised, non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen), 7 (hospitalised, intubation and mechanical ventilation, pO2/FiO2 ≥150 or SpO2/FiO2 ≥200), 8 (hospitalised mechanical ventilation pO2/FiO2 <150 (SpO2/FiO2 <200) or vasopressors or 9 (hospitalised, mechanical ventilation pO2/FiO2 <150 and vasopressors, dialysis  or ECMO) (as defined by the WHO Clinical Progression Scale.

Group B (mild-moderate disease)
4b. Ambulant or hospitalised patients with peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) >94% RA.

6. Patients taking other prohibited drugs (as outline in CST protocol) within 30 days or 5 times the half-life (whichever is longer) of enrolment 
7. Patients participating in another CTIMP trial 

Nomacopan Candidate-Specific Trial:
For the purpose of the nomacopan candidate-specific trial, appendix exclusion criteria 6 has been amended from the Master protocol as follows, to restrict the population of patients that will be included in the trial:
6. Patients taking the following prohibited drugs:
• Other complement inhibiting drug such as eculizumab (Soliris®).
• Any other drug which directly inhibits cytokines, chemokines or proinflammatory mediators such as tocilizumab (Actemra®/RoActremra®), anakinra (Kineret®), etanercept (Enbrel®), infliximab (Remicade®) or adalimumab (Humira®).
N.B. Whilst it is not thought that there is likely to be any adverse interaction between nomacopan and any of these drugs, in the context of a clinical trial, it would be impossible to distinguish the effects of those agents from that of nomacopan. Corticosteroids, antivirals and antibiotics are permitted in conjunction with nomacopan therapy.
Additional exclusion criteria specific to this candidate specific appendix are:
8. Weight less than 50kg or more than 100kg

CST-2 (EIDD-2801) additional exclusion criteria:
8.	Has a febrile respiratory illness that includes pneumonia that results in hospitalisation, or requires hospitalisation, oxygenation, mechanical ventilation, or other supportive modalities.
9.	Has a platelet count less than 50x10^9/L.
10.	Is experiencing adverse events or laboratory abnormalities that are Grade 3 or above based on the CTCAE v5 grading.
11.	Has clinically significant liver dysfunction or renal impairment.
12.	Has history of Hepatitis C infection or concurrent bacterial pneumonia.
13.	Has received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or medication) within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
14.	In the opinion of the investigator, has significant end-organ disease as a result of relevant comorbidities: chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease including diabetic ulcers.
15.	Has a SaO2<95% by oximetry or has lung disease that requires supplemental oxygen or maintenance steroids.
16.	Has any condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, put the patient at increased risk for participation in a clinical study.","Master Protocol Co-primary endpoints:

The investigator should evaluate the potential for contraceptive method failure (ie, noncompliance, recently initiated) in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.
- A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (serum test is required) within 24 hours before the first dose of study intervention.
- The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.
- Contraceptive use by women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.
- Given the elevated risk of venous thrombotic events in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, estrogen-containing contraceptives must not be started to fulfill the contraceptive requirement of this study at any time during participant’s hospitalization. If contraceptives are interrupted as standard of care management of COVID-19 patients and resumed at a later time point, such as at hospital discharge, then abstinence must be practiced for the defined period of back-up contraception per the contraceptive product labeling. After this
period, contraceptive use must adhere to Protocol.

Specifically, patients will be categorized into one of the following 8 mutually exclusive categories on Day 15:
•	Death;
•	Hospitalised, on invasive mechanical ventilation or Extracorporeal membrane  oxygenation (ECMO);
•	Hospitalised, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices;
•	Hospitalised, requiring supplemental oxygen;
•	Hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise);
•	Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care;
•	Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen;
•	Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.
The rationale behind this approach is to estimate in a clinically meaningful way whether the study drug has had a favourable clinical impact on the patient.",Day 15,"Other endpoints include:
1) Differences in time-to-event endpoints (e.g., time to at least a one category improvement in ordinal scale) by treatment will be summarized with Kaplan-Meier curves and 95% confidence bounds. The same procedure will be used to compare time to at least a two category improvement.
2) Change in ordinal scale at specific time points will be summarized by proportions (e.g., proportion
who have a 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-point improvement or 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-point worsening).
3) Duration of event (e.g., duration of mechanical ventilation) will be summarized according to median days with quartiles.
4) Binary data (e.g., incidence of new oxygen use) will be summarized as a percent with 95% confidence intervals. Comparisons between arms will be presented as differences in proportions with 95% confidence intervals.

Two intermediate, ordinal categorical outcomes assessed at Day 5 are used to  evaluate potential activity.
 are used in stage 1. Both are ordinal categorical outcomes assessed 5 days after randomisation (Day 5); the participant’s highest (i.e. most severe) observed score on Day 5 is used.
A)“pulmonary” ordinal outcome, (7 categories) are primarily defined based on oxygen requirements.
1.Can independently undertake usual activities with minimal or no symptoms
2.Symptomatic and currently unable to independently undertake usual activities but no need of supplemental oxygen (or not above premorbid requirements) 
3.Supplemental oxygen (<4 litres/min, or <4 litres/min above premorbid requirements)
4.Supplemental oxygen (≥4 litres/min, or ≥4 litres/min above premorbid requirements, but not high-flow oxygen) 
5.Non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen 
6.Invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), mechanical circulatory support, or new receipt of renal replacement therapy  
7.Death

B)“pulmonary+, ordinal outcome ( 7 categories), captures extrapulmonary complications as well as respiratory dysfunction.
1.Can independently undertake usual activities with minimal or no symptoms
2.Symptomatic and currently unable to independently undertake usual activities but no need of supplemental oxygen (or not above premorbid requirements) 
3.Supplemental oxygen (<4 litres/min, or <4 litres/min above premorbid requirements)
4.Supplemental oxygen (≥4 litres/min, or ≥4 litres/min above premorbid requirements, but not high-flow oxygen) or any of the following:  stroke (NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≤14), meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, pericarditis, new onset CHF NYHA class III or IV or worsening to class III or IV, arterial or deep venous thromboembolic events. 
5.Non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen, or signs and symptoms of an acute stroke (NIHSS >14) 
6.Invasive ventilation, ECMO or mechanical circulatory support; vasopressor therapy; or new receipt of renal replacement therapy 
7.Death

Stage 2 Outcomes to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety
The primary endpoint is time from randomisation to sustained recovery, defined as being discharged from the index hospitalisation, followed by being alive and home for 14 consecutive days prior to Day 90.
Home is defined as the level of residence or facility where the participant was residing prior to hospital admission leading to enrolment in this protocol.","Stage 1
Two intermediate outcomes to evaluate potential activity are used in
stage 1. Both are ordinal categorical outcomes assessed 5 days after
randomisation (Day 5); the participant's highest (i.e. most severe)
observed score on Day 5 is used.
Stage 2
The primary outcome is assessed during 90 days of follow-up, which is
longer than for other trials for COVID-19, which are typically 28 days.
The longer follow-up will allow better ascertainment of recovery from
the longer-term consequences of the underlying disease, and hence the
efficacy of the investigational agent. This is likely to be particularly true
for patients who experience extra-pulmonary disease in conjunction with
their COVID-19, and for patients enrolled while receiving care for life threatening
organ failure.","Several secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed. These endpoints
will be assessed for participants enrolled during both stages of the trial.
1. All-cause mortality through 90 days of follow-up
2. Composite of time to sustained recovery and mortality through 90
days of follow-up
3. Time to discharge for the initial hospitalisation
4. Days alive outside of a short-term acute care hospital up to day 90
5. Ordinal outcomes, pulmonary+ and pulmonary, on Days 1-7, and
pulmonary ordinal outcome on Days 14 and 28
6. Change in National Early Warning (NEW) score from baseline to Day 5
7. Clinical organ failure defined by development of any one or more of
the following clinical events through Day 28:
a. Respiratory dysfunction:
b. Cardiac and vascular dysfunction:
c. Renal dysfunction:
d. Hepatic dysfunction:
e. Neurological dysfunction
f. Haematological dysfunction
g. Serious infection:
8. A composite of death or clinical organ failure COVID-19-related events (see above)
9. Outcomes assessed in other treatment trials of COVID-19 for
hospitalised participants in order to facilitate cross-trial comparisons
and overviews (e.g. 6- , 7-, and 8-category ordinal scales assessed at
Days 1-7, 14 and 28; time to improvement in 1 or 2 categories of ordinal
scale; time to best 3 categories of ordinal scale, and binary outcomes
defined by improvement or worsening based on other ordinal outcomes)
10. A composite of cardiovascular events (outcomes listed above in
items 7)
11. Safety and tolerability as measured by:
a. A composite of grade 3 and 4 clinical adverse events, SAEs, or death
through Day 5 (primary safety endpoint) and through Day 28
b. Infusion-related reactions of any severity and percentage of
participants for whom the infusion was interrupted or stopped prior to
completion
c. A composite of SAEs or death through Day 90
d. Adverse events of any grade through Day 7
e. Prevalence of adverse events of any grade at day 14 and day 28

For a full list of exclusion criteria please refer to Section 5.2 of the Study Protocol and Section 5.3 for Exclusion Criteria for Peg-IFN of the Study Protocol","The main Estimand supporting the primary objective is
defined as:
• Population: Participants with CHB on stable NA therapy who received at least one dose of GSK3228836
• Treatment: 300 mg GSK3228836 for 12 or 24 weeks followed by up to 24 weeks of PegIFN therapy while on stable NA therapy
• Variable (Categorical): Participants achieving Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) (HBsAg <LLOQ and HBV DNA <LLOQ) for 24 weeks after
the planned end of sequential treatment, without use of any rescue medication
• Intercurrent Events:
o Discontinuation of, interruption in, and nonadherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN not related to any wide disruptive events (such as COVID-19 pandemic) will be ignored (treatment policy strategy).
o Ineligibility to receive PegIFN will be ignored (treatment policy strategy)
o Use of rescue medication (composite strategy).
o Wide disruptive events (such as COVID-19 pandemic) leading to discontinuation of, interruption in, and non-adherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN will be handled assuming they had not happened (hypothetical strategy).
• Population Summary: The percentage of participants in each treatment group who achieve SVR, without use of any rescue medication
The main primary estimand supporting the primary objective in participants with CHB on stable NA therapy in each treatment arm is the percentage of participants that achieve SVR (HBsAg <LLOQ and HBV DNA
<LLOQ) for 24 weeks after the planned end of sequential treatment in the absence of rescue medication, regardless of ineligibility to receive PegIFN, discontinuation of, interruption in, and non-adherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN, had they not been affected by wide disruptive events.
Three supplementary Estimands are defined to support the primary objective:
• The first supplementary Estimand is defined in the same way as the main Estimand, except the assessment time frame for patients achieving SVR will be 24 weeks after the actual end of treatment.
Therefore, the strategy for intercurrent events of treatment discontinuation will be while-on-treatment.
This supplementary estimand supporting the primary objective in participants with CHB on stable NA therapy in each treatment arm is the percentage of participants that achieve SVR (HBsAg <LLOQ and HBV DNA <LLOQ) for 24 weeks after the actual end of sequential treatment in the absence of rescue medication, regardless of ineligibility to receive
PegIFN, discontinuation of, interruption in, and nonadherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN, had they not been affected by wide disruptive events.
• The second supplementary Estimand is to understand the relationship between the PegIFN duration and achieving SVR for 24 weeks after the
actual end of treatment, defined as:
o Population: Participants with CHB on stable NA therapy who received at least one dose of GSK3228836
o Treatment: 300 mg GSK3228836 for 12 or 24 weeks followed by 24 weeks of PegIFN therapy while on stable NA therapy
o Variable: The relationship between SVR for 24 weeks after actual end of treatment and the duration of PegIFN received by participants
o Intercurrent Events: Discontinuation and delayed start of, PegIFN, will be accounted to reflect the actual duration from the first to the last
dose of PegIFN received (while-on treatment strategy).
Interruption in and other non-adherence to PegIFN will be ignored (treatment policy strategy)
Discontinuation of, interruption in and non-adherence to GSK3228836 will be ignored (treatment policy strategy)
Use of rescue medication (composite strategy).
 Wide disruptive events (such as COVID-19 pandemic) leading to discontinuation and delayed start of, PegIFN will be handled with while-on treatment strategy; wide disruptive events leading to interruption in and other non-adherence to PegIFN will be ignored (treatment policy strategy); wide disruptive events leading to discontinuation of, interruption in, and non-adherence to GSK3228836 will be
ignored (treatment policy strategy).
o Population Summary: The percentage of participants achieving SVR for 24 weeks after the actual end of treatment by PegIFN
treatment duration categorical grouping in each treatment arm
• The second supplementary Estimand (supporting the primary objective in participants with CHB on stable NA therapy) is the percentage of participants achieving SVR for 24 weeks after the actual end of
treatment by PegIFN treatment duration categorical grouping in each treatment arm, taking into account discontinuation and delayed start of PegIFN, regardless of interruption in and other nonadherence to PegIFN, regardless of discontinuation of, interruption in and non-adherence to
GSK3228836.

12, week 20, week 24 and week 36)","The Estimand supporting the objective is defined as:
• Population: Participants with CHB on stable NA therapy who received at least one dose of GSK3228836; For the time to ALT normalisation
variable, population will be aforementioned participants with baseline ALT >ULN.
• Treatment: 300 mg GSK3228836 for 12, or 24 weeks followed by 24 weeks of PegIFN therapy while on stable NA therapy
• Categorical Variables:
o Achieving HBsAg <LLOQ and HBV DNA
<LLOQ at two time points: (1) the planned end of treatment and (2) at the end of 24 weeks follow-up
o Categorical changes from baseline in HBsAg (e.g., <0.5, ≥0.5, ≥1, ≥1.5, ≥3 log10 IU/mL) at each scheduled visit or analysis window.
o ALT normalisation (ALT ≤ULN) over time in absence of rescue medication in participants with baseline ALT >ULN
Population summary is the percentage of participants in each category for each treatment group.
• Continuous Variables:
o Actual values and change from baseline over time for HBsAg, HBV DNA and HBeAg
o Actual values and change from baseline over time for HBs antibody (anti-HBsAg) and HBe antibody (anti-HBeAg) levels over time
o Actual values and change from baseline over time for ALT
Population summary is the mean values and the mean changes from baseline of each variable for participants in each treatment
group.
• Time to Event Variable:
o Time to ALT normalisation in absence of rescue medication in participants with baseline ALT>ULN
Population summary is the Turnbull’s estimator for non-parametric estimation of Time to ALT normalisation in each treatment arm
• Intercurrent Events: Discontinuation of, interruption in, and non-adherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN will be ignored (treatment policy); PegIFN ineligibility will be ignored (treatment policy); Rescue medication will be ignored (treatment policy), except for ALT normalisation which can only be achieved in the absence of rescue medication; Wide disruptive events (such as COVID-19 pandemic) leading to discontinuation of, interruption in, and nonadherence
to GSK3228836 and PegIFN will be handled with Treatment Policy Strategy.
• The group of estimands supporting this objective is the population summary for each variable in each treatment arm in the population regardless of
discontinuation of, interruption in or non-adherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN, and regardless of rescue medication (except for ALT normalisation which can only be achieved in the absence of rescue medication) or PegIFN ineligibility.
The same definition as the above secondary estimand, focusing on the timepoints following the 24 weeks off treatment period in the treatment arm of 300 mg
GSK3228836 for 12 weeks followed by up to 24 weeks of PegIFN therapy while on stable NA therapy.
The same definition as the primary estimand except
treatments and population summary are defined as:
• Treatments: Arms 1 and 2. One treatment comparison between Arms 1 & 2 up to 24 weeks off treatment
• Population summary: difference in proportion of participants who achieve SVR between treatment arms
The group of estimands supporting this objective in participants with CHB on stable NA therapy is the difference between treatment arms 1 and 2 in the
proportion of participants that achieve SVR for 24 weeks after the planned end of sequential treatment, in the absence of rescue medication, regardless of ineligibility to receive PegIFN, regardless of discontinuation of, interruption in or non-adherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN had they not been affected by wide disruptive events.","Weekly during the treatment period for up to 48 weeks with additional visits for loading dose on Day 4 and Day 11) and then decrease in frequency during the off-treatment period (9 visits over 36 weeks; Off treatment weeks: Off treatment week 1, week 2, week 4, week 8, week

Please refer to the study protocol for further objections",No,"A patient will be eligible to participate in this study if ALL the following criteria are met:
1. Adult (≥ 18 years old) men or women hospitalized or not hospitalized, diagnosed
for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR (within 48 hours prior to randomization), with at least one associated risk factor. Considered risk factors are:
• Age ≥ 65 years
• Obesity defined as BMI ≥ 30
• Recent history of uncontrolled High Blood Pressure (SBP > 150 mm Hg & DBP >100 mm Hg) according to investigator
• Treated diabetes (type I or II)
• History of ischemic cardiovascular disease 
2. Symptomatic patients must present at least 1 of the following symptoms at enrollment: fever or perceived fever (for more than 24 hours, headache, sore throat, dry cough, fatigue, chest pain or choking sensation (with no associated respiratory distress), myalgia, anosmia, ageusia or gastro-intestinal symptoms.
3. Patients with pulse oximetry arterial saturation (SpO2) ≥ 92 % on room air at
enrolment.
4. Patients with the following hematological and biochemical laboratory parameters obtained within 7 days prior to D0:
• Hemoglobin > 9.0 g dL-1
• Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1000 mm-3;
• Platelets ≥ 100,000 mm-3;
• Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL min-1 by the Cockcroft-Gault formula
• Total serum bilirubin < 2 x ULN
• Alkaline phosphatase< 2 x ULN, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) < 3 x ULN;
5. Women of childbearing potential and men receiving the study treatment and their partners must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method during the study and for 6 months (180 days) after end of study or early termination. Contraception should be in place at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Women must be surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential must use a highly effective contraceptive method. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will enter the study after confirmed menstrual period and a negative pregnancy test. Highly effective methods of contraception include true abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD) or hormonal contraception aiming at inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner. True abstinence is defined when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. In each case of delayed menstrual period (over one month between menstruation) confirmation of absence of pregnancy is required. This recommendation also applies to WOCBP with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycle. Female and male patients must not be planning pregnancy during the trial and for 6 months post completion of their participation in the trial. In addition, male patients should use condom during the trial and for 6 months (180 days) post completion of their participation in the study. Male patients must not donate sperm as long as contraception is required. For the purpose of this protocol, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a
post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Finally a man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.
6. Patients must understand, sign and date the written voluntary informed consent form at the visit prior to any protocol-specific procedures.
7. Patients able and willing to comply with study visits and procedures as per protocol.
8. Patients should be affiliated to a social security regimen (for French sites only).","Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will be excluded from the study:
1.	Patients with moderate or severe acute respiratory failure or requiring non-invasive ventilation or oxygen or with SpO2 < 92% or tachypnea (respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min).
2. Patients treated with immunosuppressors and/or immunomodulators (cf. Appendix #2).
3. Engrafted patients (organ and/or hematopoietic stem cells).
4. Patients with uncontrolled auto-immune disease.
5. Patients with known or suspected active (i.e. not controlled) bacterial, viral
(excluding COVID-19) or fungal infections.
6. Patients with preexisting, severe and not controlled organ failure.
7. History or active malignancy requiring chemotherapy or radiation therapy (excluding 2 years disease free survivor patients).
8. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.
9. Illicit drug or alcohol abuse or dependence that may compromise the patient's safety or adherence to the study protocol.
10. Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 3 months or within 5 half-lives preceding baseline, whichever is longer.
11. Hypersensitivity to ABX464 and/or its excipients.
12. Any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise the patient's safety or adherence to the study protocol.","Rate of patients with no invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV and NIV, respectively), but excluding simple nasal/mask oxygen supplementation, and who are alive at the end of the 28 days period.",Day 28,"1.Rate of patients hospitalized in both treatment groups
