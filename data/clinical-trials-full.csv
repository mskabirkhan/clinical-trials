• Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective contraception for two weeks after final dose of IMP. Women will be advised to use a hormonal method, an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), a barrier method or abstinence. 

*A clinically confident diagnosis is made where there is either swab positivity for Covid-19, or where the clinical presentation (including any of symptoms, clinical chemistry (e.g. raised D-dimer, raised CRP) and radiology (CXR, CT or ultrasound findings)) is consistent with likely Covid-19 infection. A pre-planned subgroup analysis will compare the primary outcome for those with swab positive and “clinically likely” disease.  

**At the time of recruitment, patients will be at least moderate oxygen therapy (>4 l/min O2 flow to mask or nasal cannulae; FiO2 > 0.3 for Venturi mask) to maintain pulse oximeter saturation, SpO2, in the target range set by the treating clinician. Other higher levels of oxygen support (including higher doses of oxygen, non-invasive respiratory support (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), high-flow nasal oxygen, or bi-level non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)) and invasive mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube can all be included, but patients are excluded if they have received >72 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation during their current illness.
 
***De-escalation of respiratory support is defined as a significant reduction in respiratory support that maintains saturation within the treating physicians’ target range within 24 hours of inclusion to this study. A significant reduction is any change in mode of oxygen delivery (i.e. intubated to non-invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation to standard oxygen therapy, or reduction of standard “wall” oxygen of more than 3 litres / min). Changes less than this will not be considered to be significant.

Two intermediate, ordinal categorical outcomes assessed at Day 5 are used to  evaluate potential activity.
 are used in stage 1. Both are ordinal categorical outcomes assessed 5 days after randomisation (Day 5); the participant’s highest (i.e. most severe) observed score on Day 5 is used.
A)“pulmonary” ordinal outcome, (7 categories) are primarily defined based on oxygen requirements.
1.Can independently undertake usual activities with minimal or no symptoms
2.Symptomatic and currently unable to independently undertake usual activities but no need of supplemental oxygen (or not above premorbid requirements) 
3.Supplemental oxygen (<4 litres/min, or <4 litres/min above premorbid requirements)
4.Supplemental oxygen (≥4 litres/min, or ≥4 litres/min above premorbid requirements, but not high-flow oxygen) 
5.Non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen 
6.Invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), mechanical circulatory support, or new receipt of renal replacement therapy  
7.Death

B)“pulmonary+, ordinal outcome ( 7 categories), captures extrapulmonary complications as well as respiratory dysfunction.
1.Can independently undertake usual activities with minimal or no symptoms
2.Symptomatic and currently unable to independently undertake usual activities but no need of supplemental oxygen (or not above premorbid requirements) 
3.Supplemental oxygen (<4 litres/min, or <4 litres/min above premorbid requirements)

6.Invasive ventilation, ECMO or mechanical circulatory support; vasopressor therapy; or new receipt of renal replacement therapy 
7.Death

Stage 2 Outcomes to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety
The primary endpoint is time from randomisation to sustained recovery, defined as being discharged from the index hospitalisation, followed by being alive and home for 14 consecutive days prior to Day 90.
Home is defined as the level of residence or facility where the participant was residing prior to hospital admission leading to enrolment in this protocol.","Stage 1
Two intermediate outcomes to evaluate potential activity are used in
stage 1. Both are ordinal categorical outcomes assessed 5 days after
randomisation (Day 5); the participant's highest (i.e. most severe)
observed score on Day 5 is used.
Stage 2
The primary outcome is assessed during 90 days of follow-up, which is
longer than for other trials for COVID-19, which are typically 28 days.
The longer follow-up will allow better ascertainment of recovery from
the longer-term consequences of the underlying disease, and hence the
efficacy of the investigational agent. This is likely to be particularly true
for patients who experience extra-pulmonary disease in conjunction with
their COVID-19, and for patients enrolled while receiving care for life threatening
organ failure.","Several secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed. These endpoints
will be assessed for participants enrolled during both stages of the trial.
1. All-cause mortality through 90 days of follow-up
2. Composite of time to sustained recovery and mortality through 90
days of follow-up
3. Time to discharge for the initial hospitalisation
4. Days alive outside of a short-term acute care hospital up to day 90
5. Ordinal outcomes, pulmonary+ and pulmonary, on Days 1-7, and
pulmonary ordinal outcome on Days 14 and 28
6. Change in National Early Warning (NEW) score from baseline to Day 5
7. Clinical organ failure defined by development of any one or more of
the following clinical events through Day 28:
a. Respiratory dysfunction:
b. Cardiac and vascular dysfunction:
c. Renal dysfunction:
d. Hepatic dysfunction:
e. Neurological dysfunction
f. Haematological dysfunction
g. Serious infection:
8. A composite of death or clinical organ failure COVID-19-related events (see above)
9. Outcomes assessed in other treatment trials of COVID-19 for
hospitalised participants in order to facilitate cross-trial comparisons
and overviews (e.g. 6- , 7-, and 8-category ordinal scales assessed at
Days 1-7, 14 and 28; time to improvement in 1 or 2 categories of ordinal
scale; time to best 3 categories of ordinal scale, and binary outcomes
defined by improvement or worsening based on other ordinal outcomes)
10. A composite of cardiovascular events (outcomes listed above in
items 7)
11. Safety and tolerability as measured by:
a. A composite of grade 3 and 4 clinical adverse events, SAEs, or death
through Day 5 (primary safety endpoint) and through Day 28
b. Infusion-related reactions of any severity and percentage of
participants for whom the infusion was interrupted or stopped prior to

For a full list of exclusion criteria please refer to Section 5.2 of the Study Protocol and Section 5.3 for Exclusion Criteria for Peg-IFN of the Study Protocol","The main Estimand supporting the primary objective is
defined as:
• Population: Participants with CHB on stable NA therapy who received at least one dose of GSK3228836
• Treatment: 300 mg GSK3228836 for 12 or 24 weeks followed by up to 24 weeks of PegIFN therapy while on stable NA therapy
• Variable (Categorical): Participants achieving Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) (HBsAg <LLOQ and HBV DNA <LLOQ) for 24 weeks after
the planned end of sequential treatment, without use of any rescue medication
• Intercurrent Events:
o Discontinuation of, interruption in, and nonadherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN not related to any wide disruptive events (such as COVID-19 pandemic) will be ignored (treatment policy strategy).
o Ineligibility to receive PegIFN will be ignored (treatment policy strategy)
o Use of rescue medication (composite strategy).
o Wide disruptive events (such as COVID-19 pandemic) leading to discontinuation of, interruption in, and non-adherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN will be handled assuming they had not happened (hypothetical strategy).
• Population Summary: The percentage of participants in each treatment group who achieve SVR, without use of any rescue medication
The main primary estimand supporting the primary objective in participants with CHB on stable NA therapy in each treatment arm is the percentage of participants that achieve SVR (HBsAg <LLOQ and HBV DNA
<LLOQ) for 24 weeks after the planned end of sequential treatment in the absence of rescue medication, regardless of ineligibility to receive PegIFN, discontinuation of, interruption in, and non-adherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN, had they not been affected by wide disruptive events.
Three supplementary Estimands are defined to support the primary objective:
• The first supplementary Estimand is defined in the same way as the main Estimand, except the assessment time frame for patients achieving SVR will be 24 weeks after the actual end of treatment.
Therefore, the strategy for intercurrent events of treatment discontinuation will be while-on-treatment.
This supplementary estimand supporting the primary objective in participants with CHB on stable NA therapy in each treatment arm is the percentage of participants that achieve SVR (HBsAg <LLOQ and HBV DNA <LLOQ) for 24 weeks after the actual end of sequential treatment in the absence of rescue medication, regardless of ineligibility to receive
PegIFN, discontinuation of, interruption in, and nonadherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN, had they not been affected by wide disruptive events.
• The second supplementary Estimand is to understand the relationship between the PegIFN duration and achieving SVR for 24 weeks after the
actual end of treatment, defined as:
o Population: Participants with CHB on stable NA therapy who received at least one dose of GSK3228836
o Treatment: 300 mg GSK3228836 for 12 or 24 weeks followed by 24 weeks of PegIFN therapy while on stable NA therapy
o Variable: The relationship between SVR for 24 weeks after actual end of treatment and the duration of PegIFN received by participants
o Intercurrent Events: Discontinuation and delayed start of, PegIFN, will be accounted to reflect the actual duration from the first to the last
dose of PegIFN received (while-on treatment strategy).
Interruption in and other non-adherence to PegIFN will be ignored (treatment policy strategy)
Discontinuation of, interruption in and non-adherence to GSK3228836 will be ignored (treatment policy strategy)
Use of rescue medication (composite strategy).
 Wide disruptive events (such as COVID-19 pandemic) leading to discontinuation and delayed start of, PegIFN will be handled with while-on treatment strategy; wide disruptive events leading to interruption in and other non-adherence to PegIFN will be ignored (treatment policy strategy); wide disruptive events leading to discontinuation of, interruption in, and non-adherence to GSK3228836 will be
ignored (treatment policy strategy).
o Population Summary: The percentage of participants achieving SVR for 24 weeks after the actual end of treatment by PegIFN
treatment duration categorical grouping in each treatment arm
• The second supplementary Estimand (supporting the primary objective in participants with CHB on stable NA therapy) is the percentage of participants achieving SVR for 24 weeks after the actual end of
treatment by PegIFN treatment duration categorical grouping in each treatment arm, taking into account discontinuation and delayed start of PegIFN, regardless of interruption in and other nonadherence to PegIFN, regardless of discontinuation of, interruption in and non-adherence to
GSK3228836.

• Population: Participants with CHB on stable NA therapy who received at least one dose of GSK3228836; For the time to ALT normalisation
variable, population will be aforementioned participants with baseline ALT >ULN.
• Treatment: 300 mg GSK3228836 for 12, or 24 weeks followed by 24 weeks of PegIFN therapy while on stable NA therapy
• Categorical Variables:
o Achieving HBsAg <LLOQ and HBV DNA
<LLOQ at two time points: (1) the planned end of treatment and (2) at the end of 24 weeks follow-up
o Categorical changes from baseline in HBsAg (e.g., <0.5, ≥0.5, ≥1, ≥1.5, ≥3 log10 IU/mL) at each scheduled visit or analysis window.
o ALT normalisation (ALT ≤ULN) over time in absence of rescue medication in participants with baseline ALT >ULN
Population summary is the percentage of participants in each category for each treatment group.
• Continuous Variables:
o Actual values and change from baseline over time for HBsAg, HBV DNA and HBeAg
o Actual values and change from baseline over time for HBs antibody (anti-HBsAg) and HBe antibody (anti-HBeAg) levels over time
o Actual values and change from baseline over time for ALT
Population summary is the mean values and the mean changes from baseline of each variable for participants in each treatment
group.
• Time to Event Variable:
o Time to ALT normalisation in absence of rescue medication in participants with baseline ALT>ULN
Population summary is the Turnbull’s estimator for non-parametric estimation of Time to ALT normalisation in each treatment arm
• Intercurrent Events: Discontinuation of, interruption in, and non-adherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN will be ignored (treatment policy); PegIFN ineligibility will be ignored (treatment policy); Rescue medication will be ignored (treatment policy), except for ALT normalisation which can only be achieved in the absence of rescue medication; Wide disruptive events (such as COVID-19 pandemic) leading to discontinuation of, interruption in, and nonadherence
to GSK3228836 and PegIFN will be handled with Treatment Policy Strategy.
• The group of estimands supporting this objective is the population summary for each variable in each treatment arm in the population regardless of
discontinuation of, interruption in or non-adherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN, and regardless of rescue medication (except for ALT normalisation which can only be achieved in the absence of rescue medication) or PegIFN ineligibility.
The same definition as the above secondary estimand, focusing on the timepoints following the 24 weeks off treatment period in the treatment arm of 300 mg
GSK3228836 for 12 weeks followed by up to 24 weeks of PegIFN therapy while on stable NA therapy.
The same definition as the primary estimand except
treatments and population summary are defined as:
• Treatments: Arms 1 and 2. One treatment comparison between Arms 1 & 2 up to 24 weeks off treatment
• Population summary: difference in proportion of participants who achieve SVR between treatment arms
The group of estimands supporting this objective in participants with CHB on stable NA therapy is the difference between treatment arms 1 and 2 in the
proportion of participants that achieve SVR for 24 weeks after the planned end of sequential treatment, in the absence of rescue medication, regardless of ineligibility to receive PegIFN, regardless of discontinuation of, interruption in or non-adherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN had they not been affected by wide disruptive events.","Weekly during the treatment period for up to 48 weeks with additional visits for loading dose on Day 4 and Day 11) and then decrease in frequency during the off-treatment period (9 visits over 36 weeks; Off treatment weeks: Off treatment week 1, week 2, week 4, week 8, week

Please refer to the study protocol for further objections",No,"A patient will be eligible to participate in this study if ALL the following criteria are met:
1. Adult (≥ 18 years old) men or women hospitalized or not hospitalized, diagnosed
for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR (within 48 hours prior to randomization), with at least one associated risk factor. Considered risk factors are:
• Age ≥ 65 years
• Obesity defined as BMI ≥ 30
• Recent history of uncontrolled High Blood Pressure (SBP > 150 mm Hg & DBP >100 mm Hg) according to investigator
• Treated diabetes (type I or II)
• History of ischemic cardiovascular disease 
2. Symptomatic patients must present at least 1 of the following symptoms at enrollment: fever or perceived fever (for more than 24 hours, headache, sore throat, dry cough, fatigue, chest pain or choking sensation (with no associated respiratory distress), myalgia, anosmia, ageusia or gastro-intestinal symptoms.
3. Patients with pulse oximetry arterial saturation (SpO2) ≥ 92 % on room air at
enrolment.
4. Patients with the following hematological and biochemical laboratory parameters obtained within 7 days prior to D0:
• Hemoglobin > 9.0 g dL-1
• Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1000 mm-3;
• Platelets ≥ 100,000 mm-3;
• Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL min-1 by the Cockcroft-Gault formula
• Total serum bilirubin < 2 x ULN
• Alkaline phosphatase< 2 x ULN, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) < 3 x ULN;
5. Women of childbearing potential and men receiving the study treatment and their partners must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method during the study and for 6 months (180 days) after end of study or early termination. Contraception should be in place at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Women must be surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential must use a highly effective contraceptive method. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will enter the study after confirmed menstrual period and a negative pregnancy test. Highly effective methods of contraception include true abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD) or hormonal contraception aiming at inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner. True abstinence is defined when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. In each case of delayed menstrual period (over one month between menstruation) confirmation of absence of pregnancy is required. This recommendation also applies to WOCBP with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycle. Female and male patients must not be planning pregnancy during the trial and for 6 months post completion of their participation in the trial. In addition, male patients should use condom during the trial and for 6 months (180 days) post completion of their participation in the study. Male patients must not donate sperm as long as contraception is required. For the purpose of this protocol, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a
post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Finally a man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.
6. Patients must understand, sign and date the written voluntary informed consent form at the visit prior to any protocol-specific procedures.
7. Patients able and willing to comply with study visits and procedures as per protocol.
8. Patients should be affiliated to a social security regimen (for French sites only).","Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will be excluded from the study:

2. Patients treated with immunosuppressors and/or immunomodulators (cf. Appendix #2).
3. Engrafted patients (organ and/or hematopoietic stem cells).
