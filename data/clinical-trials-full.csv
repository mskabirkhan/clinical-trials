The aims of this sub-study are to determine if the following endpoints in exposed factor workers who are not following recommended social distancing are effective.

If hydroxychloroquine is effective at preventing COVID-19 (a WHO score 1 or above). 

Secondary endpoint:
The minimum effective dosing schedule of hydrochloroquine for preventing COVID-19 and/or mitigating severity in onset of the disease.

To provide reliable estimates of the effect of study treatments on postoperative pulmonary complications during the COVID-19 pandemic.","To assess the effects of study treatments on:

-Overall SARS-CoV-2 infected rate
-Duration of intensive care and total hospital stay
-Pulmonary function in keeping with WHO Solidarity Trial outcome scale 
-Safety and tolerability of study treatments",No,"Testing and criteria for diagnosis COVID-19 is likely to rapidly evolve over the course of this trial and will vary internationally. Therefore, the following pragmatic definitions will be applied:
•	Confirmed positive test for COVID-19: either a laboratory test (performed according to each participating hospital’s local protocols) or a computed tomography (CT) thorax scan (based on individual radiologist interpretation and diagnosis) that confirms COVID-19 diagnosis.
•	Confirmed negative test for COVID-19: a laboratory test (performed according to each participating hospital’s local protocols) that is negative for COVID-19 diagnosis.


Patients are eligible for the study if ALL of the following apply:
-Aged 18 years or above
-Planned to undergo any type of elective or emergency inpatient surgery requiring general or regional anaesthesia (such as vulnerable patients undergoing surgery for a fractured neck of femur)
-Asymptomatic of COVID-19, including patients with: those not tested, negative test results, postive test but no symptoms
-Able to provide informed patient consent

The eligibility criteria may change over time to reflect new diagnostic tests or changing epidemiology. This will be reviewed regularly by the Trial Management Group and Data Monitoring Committee. For example, if routine serological screening before surgery becomes feasible during the course of the trial in any participating hospital, only seronegative patients may be eligible for the trial.","Patients are not eligible for the study if ANY of the following apply:

--Procedures under local anaesthesia
-Symptomatic COVID-19 infection (by confirmed COVID-19 test or a clinical diagnosis); these patients will be eligible for the RECOVERY trial.
-Existing regular preoperative treatment with trial drugs
-Known history of adverse reaction/contraindication to trial drugs
-Pregnancy (including caesarean section)


It is anticipated that very few patients listed for surgery will have symptomatic COVID-19 infection at the time of surgery, and although any such patients will be excluded from this trial, they will be eligible for the parallel RECOVERY trial.","Trial outcomes will only be based on routinely available data. Patients will not undergo any additional investigations for trial purposes.

• Male or female, aged 18 and above 
• Clinically confident or proven Covid-19 disease* who require respiratory support** and who have not undergone significant de-escalation of respiratory support*** (i.e. are not in a recovery phase).
• Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective contraception for two weeks after final dose of IMP. Women will be advised to use a hormonal method, an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), a barrier method or abstinence. 

*A clinically confident diagnosis is made where there is either swab positivity for Covid-19, or where the clinical presentation (including any of symptoms, clinical chemistry (e.g. raised D-dimer, raised CRP) and radiology (CXR, CT or ultrasound findings)) is consistent with likely Covid-19 infection. A pre-planned subgroup analysis will compare the primary outcome for those with swab positive and “clinically likely” disease.  

**At the time of recruitment, patients will be at least moderate oxygen therapy (>4 l/min O2 flow to mask or nasal cannulae; FiO2 > 0.3 for Venturi mask) to maintain pulse oximeter saturation, SpO2, in the target range set by the treating clinician. Other higher levels of oxygen support (including higher doses of oxygen, non-invasive respiratory support (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), high-flow nasal oxygen, or bi-level non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)) and invasive mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube can all be included, but patients are excluded if they have received >72 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation during their current illness.
 
***De-escalation of respiratory support is defined as a significant reduction in respiratory support that maintains saturation within the treating physicians’ target range within 24 hours of inclusion to this study. A significant reduction is any change in mode of oxygen delivery (i.e. intubated to non-invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation to standard oxygen therapy, or reduction of standard “wall” oxygen of more than 3 litres / min). Changes less than this will not be considered to be significant.

b. Female Participants 
-Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomization without an alternative medical cause.

o Women < 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range. 
o Women ≥50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment. 
- Female participants of childbearing potential must use one highly effective form of birth control. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
