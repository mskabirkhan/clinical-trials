-Duration of intensive care and total hospital stay
-Pulmonary function in keeping with WHO Solidarity Trial outcome scale 
-Safety and tolerability of study treatments",No,"Testing and criteria for diagnosis COVID-19 is likely to rapidly evolve over the course of this trial and will vary internationally. Therefore, the following pragmatic definitions will be applied:
•	Confirmed positive test for COVID-19: either a laboratory test (performed according to each participating hospital’s local protocols) or a computed tomography (CT) thorax scan (based on individual radiologist interpretation and diagnosis) that confirms COVID-19 diagnosis.
•	Confirmed negative test for COVID-19: a laboratory test (performed according to each participating hospital’s local protocols) that is negative for COVID-19 diagnosis.


Patients are eligible for the study if ALL of the following apply:
-Aged 18 years or above
-Planned to undergo any type of elective or emergency inpatient surgery requiring general or regional anaesthesia (such as vulnerable patients undergoing surgery for a fractured neck of femur)
-Asymptomatic of COVID-19, including patients with: those not tested, negative test results, postive test but no symptoms
-Able to provide informed patient consent

The eligibility criteria may change over time to reflect new diagnostic tests or changing epidemiology. This will be reviewed regularly by the Trial Management Group and Data Monitoring Committee. For example, if routine serological screening before surgery becomes feasible during the course of the trial in any participating hospital, only seronegative patients may be eligible for the trial.","Patients are not eligible for the study if ANY of the following apply:

--Procedures under local anaesthesia
-Symptomatic COVID-19 infection (by confirmed COVID-19 test or a clinical diagnosis); these patients will be eligible for the RECOVERY trial.
-Existing regular preoperative treatment with trial drugs
-Known history of adverse reaction/contraindication to trial drugs
-Pregnancy (including caesarean section)


It is anticipated that very few patients listed for surgery will have symptomatic COVID-19 infection at the time of surgery, and although any such patients will be excluded from this trial, they will be eligible for the parallel RECOVERY trial.","Trial outcomes will only be based on routinely available data.

Two intermediate, ordinal categorical outcomes assessed at Day 5 are used to  evaluate potential activity.
 are used in stage 1. Both are ordinal categorical outcomes assessed 5 days after randomisation (Day 5); the participant’s highest (i.e. most severe) observed score on Day 5 is used.
A)“pulmonary” ordinal outcome, (7 categories) are primarily defined based on oxygen requirements.
1.Can independently undertake usual activities with minimal or no symptoms
2.Symptomatic and currently unable to independently undertake usual activities but no need of supplemental oxygen (or not above premorbid requirements) 
3.Supplemental oxygen (<4 litres/min, or <4 litres/min above premorbid requirements)
4.Supplemental oxygen (≥4 litres/min, or ≥4 litres/min above premorbid requirements, but not high-flow oxygen) 
5.Non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen 
6.Invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), mechanical circulatory support, or new receipt of renal replacement therapy  
7.Death

B)“pulmonary+, ordinal outcome ( 7 categories), captures extrapulmonary complications as well as respiratory dysfunction.
1.Can independently undertake usual activities with minimal or no symptoms
2.Symptomatic and currently unable to independently undertake usual activities but no need of supplemental oxygen (or not above premorbid requirements) 
3.Supplemental oxygen (<4 litres/min, or <4 litres/min above premorbid requirements)
4.Supplemental oxygen (≥4 litres/min, or ≥4 litres/min above premorbid requirements, but not high-flow oxygen) or any of the following:  stroke (NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≤14), meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, pericarditis, new onset CHF NYHA class III or IV or worsening to class III or IV, arterial or deep venous thromboembolic events. 
5.Non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen, or signs and symptoms of an acute stroke (NIHSS >14) 
6.Invasive ventilation, ECMO or mechanical circulatory support; vasopressor therapy; or new receipt of renal replacement therapy 
7.Death

Stage 2 Outcomes to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety
The primary endpoint is time from randomisation to sustained recovery, defined as being discharged from the index hospitalisation, followed by being alive and home for 14 consecutive days prior to Day 90.
Home is defined as the level of residence or facility where the participant was residing prior to hospital admission leading to enrolment in this protocol.","Stage 1
Two intermediate outcomes to evaluate potential activity are used in
stage 1. Both are ordinal categorical outcomes assessed 5 days after
randomisation (Day 5); the participant's highest (i.e. most severe)
observed score on Day 5 is used.
Stage 2
The primary outcome is assessed during 90 days of follow-up, which is
longer than for other trials for COVID-19, which are typically 28 days.
The longer follow-up will allow better ascertainment of recovery from
the longer-term consequences of the underlying disease, and hence the
efficacy of the investigational agent. This is likely to be particularly true
for patients who experience extra-pulmonary disease in conjunction with
their COVID-19, and for patients enrolled while receiving care for life threatening
organ failure.","Several secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed. These endpoints
will be assessed for participants enrolled during both stages of the trial.
1. All-cause mortality through 90 days of follow-up
2. Composite of time to sustained recovery and mortality through 90
days of follow-up
3. Time to discharge for the initial hospitalisation
4. Days alive outside of a short-term acute care hospital up to day 90
5. Ordinal outcomes, pulmonary+ and pulmonary, on Days 1-7, and
pulmonary ordinal outcome on Days 14 and 28
6. Change in National Early Warning (NEW) score from baseline to Day 5
7. Clinical organ failure defined by development of any one or more of
the following clinical events through Day 28:
a. Respiratory dysfunction:
b. Cardiac and vascular dysfunction:
c. Renal dysfunction:
d. Hepatic dysfunction:
e. Neurological dysfunction
f. Haematological dysfunction
g. Serious infection:
8. A composite of death or clinical organ failure COVID-19-related events (see above)
9. Outcomes assessed in other treatment trials of COVID-19 for
hospitalised participants in order to facilitate cross-trial comparisons
and overviews (e.g. 6- , 7-, and 8-category ordinal scales assessed at
Days 1-7, 14 and 28; time to improvement in 1 or 2 categories of ordinal
scale; time to best 3 categories of ordinal scale, and binary outcomes
defined by improvement or worsening based on other ordinal outcomes)
10. A composite of cardiovascular events (outcomes listed above in
items 7)
11. Safety and tolerability as measured by:
a. A composite of grade 3 and 4 clinical adverse events, SAEs, or death
through Day 5 (primary safety endpoint) and through Day 28
b. Infusion-related reactions of any severity and percentage of
participants for whom the infusion was interrupted or stopped prior to
completion
c. A composite of SAEs or death through Day 90
d. Adverse events of any grade through Day 7
e. Prevalence of adverse events of any grade at day 14 and day 28

For a full list of exclusion criteria please refer to Section 5.2 of the Study Protocol and Section 5.3 for Exclusion Criteria for Peg-IFN of the Study Protocol","The main Estimand supporting the primary objective is
defined as:
• Population: Participants with CHB on stable NA therapy who received at least one dose of GSK3228836
• Treatment: 300 mg GSK3228836 for 12 or 24 weeks followed by up to 24 weeks of PegIFN therapy while on stable NA therapy
• Variable (Categorical): Participants achieving Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) (HBsAg <LLOQ and HBV DNA <LLOQ) for 24 weeks after
the planned end of sequential treatment, without use of any rescue medication
• Intercurrent Events:
o Discontinuation of, interruption in, and nonadherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN not related to any wide disruptive events (such as COVID-19 pandemic) will be ignored (treatment policy strategy).
o Ineligibility to receive PegIFN will be ignored (treatment policy strategy)
o Use of rescue medication (composite strategy).
o Wide disruptive events (such as COVID-19 pandemic) leading to discontinuation of, interruption in, and non-adherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN will be handled assuming they had not happened (hypothetical strategy).
• Population Summary: The percentage of participants in each treatment group who achieve SVR, without use of any rescue medication
The main primary estimand supporting the primary objective in participants with CHB on stable NA therapy in each treatment arm is the percentage of participants that achieve SVR (HBsAg <LLOQ and HBV DNA
<LLOQ) for 24 weeks after the planned end of sequential treatment in the absence of rescue medication, regardless of ineligibility to receive PegIFN, discontinuation of, interruption in, and non-adherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN, had they not been affected by wide disruptive events.
Three supplementary Estimands are defined to support the primary objective:
• The first supplementary Estimand is defined in the same way as the main Estimand, except the assessment time frame for patients achieving SVR will be 24 weeks after the actual end of treatment.
Therefore, the strategy for intercurrent events of treatment discontinuation will be while-on-treatment.
This supplementary estimand supporting the primary objective in participants with CHB on stable NA therapy in each treatment arm is the percentage of participants that achieve SVR (HBsAg <LLOQ and HBV DNA <LLOQ) for 24 weeks after the actual end of sequential treatment in the absence of rescue medication, regardless of ineligibility to receive
PegIFN, discontinuation of, interruption in, and nonadherence to GSK3228836 and PegIFN, had they not been affected by wide disruptive events.
• The second supplementary Estimand is to understand the relationship between the PegIFN duration and achieving SVR for 24 weeks after the
actual end of treatment, defined as:
o Population: Participants with CHB on stable NA therapy who received at least one dose of GSK3228836
o Treatment: 300 mg GSK3228836 for 12 or 24 weeks followed by 24 weeks of PegIFN therapy while on stable NA therapy
o Variable: The relationship between SVR for 24 weeks after actual end of treatment and the duration of PegIFN received by participants
o Intercurrent Events: Discontinuation and delayed start of, PegIFN, will be accounted to reflect the actual duration from the first to the last
dose of PegIFN received (while-on treatment strategy).
Interruption in and other non-adherence to PegIFN will be ignored (treatment policy strategy)
Discontinuation of, interruption in and non-adherence to GSK3228836 will be ignored (treatment policy strategy)
Use of rescue medication (composite strategy).
 Wide disruptive events (such as COVID-19 pandemic) leading to discontinuation and delayed start of, PegIFN will be handled with while-on treatment strategy; wide disruptive events leading to interruption in and other non-adherence to PegIFN will be ignored (treatment policy strategy); wide disruptive events leading to discontinuation of, interruption in, and non-adherence to GSK3228836 will be
ignored (treatment policy strategy).
o Population Summary: The percentage of participants achieving SVR for 24 weeks after the actual end of treatment by PegIFN
treatment duration categorical grouping in each treatment arm
• The second supplementary Estimand (supporting the primary objective in participants with CHB on stable NA therapy) is the percentage of participants achieving SVR for 24 weeks after the actual end of
treatment by PegIFN treatment duration categorical grouping in each treatment arm, taking into account discontinuation and delayed start of PegIFN, regardless of interruption in and other nonadherence to PegIFN, regardless of discontinuation of, interruption in and non-adherence to

• Alkaline phosphatase< 2 x ULN, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) < 3 x ULN;
5. Women of childbearing potential and men receiving the study treatment and their partners must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method during the study and for 6 months (180 days) after end of study or early termination. Contraception should be in place at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Women must be surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential must use a highly effective contraceptive method. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will enter the study after confirmed menstrual period and a negative pregnancy test. Highly effective methods of contraception include true abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD) or hormonal contraception aiming at inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner. True abstinence is defined when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. In each case of delayed menstrual period (over one month between menstruation) confirmation of absence of pregnancy is required. This recommendation also applies to WOCBP with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycle. Female and male patients must not be planning pregnancy during the trial and for 6 months post completion of their participation in the trial. In addition, male patients should use condom during the trial and for 6 months (180 days) post completion of their participation in the study. Male patients must not donate sperm as long as contraception is required. For the purpose of this protocol, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a
post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Finally a man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.
