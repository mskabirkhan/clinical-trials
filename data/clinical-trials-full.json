This study will involve the use of a digital diary on which home blood pressure recording will be entered by the participant.  During the early part of the study blood pressure recordings will be assessed by the study team to see if the participant should stay on their existing medication regime- if blood pressure is okay- or if blood pressure is raised, participants will be sent liquid amlodipine in the post and the dose of this will be adjusted with the aim of better blood pressure control.

Negative result from point of care SARS-CoV-2 serology resting at screening.\n5. Contraceptive use by men or women:\n(a) Male Participants: Contraception for male participants is not required, however, to avoid the transfer of any fluids, all male participants must use a condom from Day 1 and agree to continue through 365 days following administration of the IMP.\n(b) Female Participants:\n-Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomization without an alternative medical cause. The following agespecific requirements apply:\no Women < 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range.\no Women \u2265 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment.\n- Female participants of childbearing potential must use one highly effective form of birth control. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must agree to use one highly effective method of birth control, as defined in the protocol from Day 1 and agree to continue through 365 days following administration of the IMP. Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together. All women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at Visit 1 and throughout the study as indicated per the SoA\n6.

      "E.3 Principal inclusion criteria": "A patient will be eligible to participate in this study if ALL the following criteria are met:\n1. Adult (\u2265 18 years old) men or women hospitalized or not hospitalized, diagnosed\nfor SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR (within 48 hours prior to randomization), with at least one associated risk factor. Considered risk factors are:\n\u2022 Age \u2265 65 years\n\u2022 Obesity defined as BMI \u2265 30\n\u2022 Recent history of uncontrolled High Blood Pressure (SBP > 150 mm Hg & DBP >100 mm Hg) according to investigator\n\u2022 Treated diabetes (type I or II)\n\u2022 History of ischemic cardiovascular disease \n2. Symptomatic patients must present at least 1 of the following symptoms at enrollment: fever or perceived fever (for more than 24 hours, headache, sore throat, dry cough, fatigue, chest pain or choking sensation (with no associated respiratory distress), myalgia, anosmia, ageusia or gastro-intestinal symptoms.\n3. Patients with pulse oximetry arterial saturation (SpO2) \u2265 92 % on room air at\nenrolment.\n4. Patients with the following hematological and biochemical laboratory parameters obtained within 7 days prior to D0:\n\u2022 Hemoglobin > 9.0 g dL-1\n\u2022 Absolute Neutrophil Count \u2265 1000 mm-3;\n\u2022 Platelets \u2265 100,000 mm-3;\n\u2022 Creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL min-1 by the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n\u2022 Total serum bilirubin < 2 x ULN\n\u2022 Alkaline phosphatase< 2 x ULN, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) < 3 x ULN;\n5. Women of childbearing potential and men receiving the study treatment and their partners must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method during the study and for 6 months (180 days) after end of study or early termination. Contraception should be in place at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Women must be surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential must use a highly effective contraceptive method. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will enter the study after confirmed menstrual period and a negative pregnancy test. Highly effective methods of contraception include true abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD) or hormonal contraception aiming at inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner. True abstinence is defined when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. In each case of delayed menstrual period (over one month between menstruation) confirmation of absence of pregnancy is required. This recommendation also applies to WOCBP with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycle. Female and male patients must not be planning pregnancy during the trial and for 6 months post completion of their participation in the trial. In addition, male patients should use condom during the trial and for 6 months (180 days) post completion of their participation in the study. Male patients must not donate sperm as long as contraception is required. For the purpose of this protocol, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a\npost-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Finally a man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.\n6. Patients must understand, sign and date the written voluntary informed consent form at the visit prior to any protocol-specific procedures.\n7. Patients able and willing to comply with study visits and procedures as per protocol.\n8. Patients should be affiliated to a social security regimen (for French sites only).",
