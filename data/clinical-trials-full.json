      "E.3 Principal inclusion criteria": "Testing and criteria for diagnosis COVID-19 is likely to rapidly evolve over the course of this trial and will vary internationally. Therefore, the following pragmatic definitions will be applied:\n\u2022\tConfirmed positive test for COVID-19: either a laboratory test (performed according to each participating hospital\u2019s local protocols) or a computed tomography (CT) thorax scan (based on individual radiologist interpretation and diagnosis) that confirms COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\u2022\tConfirmed negative test for COVID-19: a laboratory test (performed according to each participating hospital\u2019s local protocols) that is negative for COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\n\nPatients are eligible for the study if ALL of the following apply:\n-Aged 18 years or above\n-Planned to undergo any type of elective or emergency inpatient surgery requiring general or regional anaesthesia (such as vulnerable patients undergoing surgery for a fractured neck of femur)\n-Asymptomatic of COVID-19, including patients with: those not tested, negative test results, postive test but no symptoms\n-Able to provide informed patient consent\n\nThe eligibility criteria may change over time to reflect new diagnostic tests or changing epidemiology. This will be reviewed regularly by the Trial Management Group and Data Monitoring Committee. For example, if routine serological screening before surgery becomes feasible during the course of the trial in any participating hospital, only seronegative patients may be eligible for the trial.",
      "E.4 Principal exclusion criteria": "Patients are not eligible for the study if ANY of the following apply:\n\n--Procedures under local anaesthesia\n-Symptomatic COVID-19 infection (by confirmed COVID-19 test or a clinical diagnosis); these patients will be eligible for the RECOVERY trial.\n-Existing regular preoperative treatment with trial drugs\n-Known history of adverse reaction/contraindication to trial drugs\n-Pregnancy (including caesarean section)\n\n\nIt is anticipated that very few patients listed for surgery will have symptomatic COVID-19 infection at the time of surgery, and although any such patients will be excluded from this trial, they will be eligible for the parallel RECOVERY trial.",
      "E.5.1 Primary end point(s)": "Trial outcomes will only be based on routinely available data. Patients will not undergo any additional investigations for trial purposes.\n\nPrimary outcome measure\nThe primary outcome is any one of the following COVID-19 specific, inpatient, postoperative pulmonary complications  (definitions are given in an Appendix in the protocol and through brief online training):\n\u2022\tPneumonia\n\u2022\tAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n\u2022\tDeath\n\nDefinitions for each outcome are provided in the protocol.

Male Participants: Contraception for male participants is not required, however, to avoid the transfer of any fluids, all male participants must use a condom from Day1 and agree to continue through365 days following administration of the IMP. \nb. Female Participants \n-Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomization without an alternative medical cause. The following age specific requirements apply: \no Women < 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range. \no Women \u226550 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment. \n- Female participants of childbearing potential must use one highly effective form of birth control. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must agree to use one highly effective method of birth control, as defined below, from Day1 and agree to continue through 365 days following administration of the IMP. Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together. All women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at Visit 1 and throughout the study as indicated per the SoA.\n6. Able to understand and comply with study requirements/procedures (if applicable, with assistance by caregiver, surrogate, or legally authorized representative)based on the assessment of the investigator. \n7.

Negative result from point of care SARS-CoV-2 serology resting at screening.\n5. Contraceptive use by men or women:\n(a) Male Participants: Contraception for male participants is not required, however, to avoid the transfer of any fluids, all male participants must use a condom from Day 1 and agree to continue through 365 days following administration of the IMP.\n(b) Female Participants:\n-Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomization without an alternative medical cause. The following agespecific requirements apply:\no Women < 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range.\no Women \u2265 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment.\n- Female participants of childbearing potential must use one highly effective form of birth control. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must agree to use one highly effective method of birth control, as defined in the protocol from Day 1 and agree to continue through 365 days following administration of the IMP. Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together. All women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at Visit 1 and throughout the study as indicated per the SoA\n6.

Positive virus test for SARS-CoV-2 using a validated molecular assay (e.g. RT-PCR). Patients who had positive virus test for SARS-CoV-2 prior to hospitalisation will be randomised no later than 48 hours after hospital admission. If the virus test was performed more than 96 hours prior to hospitalisation, the test will have to be repeated in the hospital prior to randomisation. Only patients whose repeated virus test is positive will be randomised, no later than 48 hours after confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients who had positive virus test for SARS-CoV-2 after hospitalisation will be randomised no later than 48 hours after confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n4. Require oxygen therapy via nasal prongs or mask (OSCI score of 4).\n5. Provide informed consent.\n6. Female patients must be \u22651 year post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using a highly effective method of contraception. Acceptable highly effective methods of contraception include\u037e\n\u2022 bilateral tubal occlusion\n\u2022 intrauterine device (provided coils are copper-banded)\n\u2022 levonorgestrel intrauterine system (e.g., Mirena\u2122)\n\u2022 medroxyprogesterone injections (e.g., Depo-Provera\u2122)\n\u2022 etonogestrel implants (e.g., Implanon\u2122, Norplan\u2122)\n\u2022 normal and low dose combined oral pills\n\u2022 norelgestromin/ ethinylestradiol transdermal system\n\u2022 intravaginal device (e.g., ethinylestradiol and etonogestrel), desogestrel (e.g., Cerazette\u2122)\n\u2022 total sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse)\n\u2022 vasectomised sexual partner.\nWomen should have been stable on their chosen method of birth control for a minimum of 3 months before entering the trial and should continue with birth control for 1 month after the last dose of inhaled IFN-\u03b21a/matching placebo. In addition to the highly effective method of contraception (except for the practice of total sexual abstinence), a condom (in UK with spermicides) should be used by the male partner for sexual intercourse from randomisation (Visit 2) and for 1 month after the last dose of inhaled IFN-\u03b21a/matching placebo to prevent pregnancy.\n7. Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal\nif they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomisation without an alternative medical cause. The following age specific requirements apply:\n\u2022 Women <50 years old will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and if follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are in the\npostmenopausal range.\n\u2022 Women \u226550 years old will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment.\n\nIf, in the setting of the pandemic, the use of an acceptable birth control method is not possible, the decision to enrol a woman of childbearing potential should be based on the benefit-risk for the patient, which should be discussed with the patient at the time of the informed consent.",

      "E.3 Principal inclusion criteria": "A patient will be eligible to participate in this study if ALL the following criteria are met:\n1. Adult (\u2265 18 years old) men or women hospitalized or not hospitalized, diagnosed\nfor SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR (within 48 hours prior to randomization), with at least one associated risk factor. Considered risk factors are:\n\u2022 Age \u2265 65 years\n\u2022 Obesity defined as BMI \u2265 30\n\u2022 Recent history of uncontrolled High Blood Pressure (SBP > 150 mm Hg & DBP >100 mm Hg) according to investigator\n\u2022 Treated diabetes (type I or II)\n\u2022 History of ischemic cardiovascular disease \n2. Symptomatic patients must present at least 1 of the following symptoms at enrollment: fever or perceived fever (for more than 24 hours, headache, sore throat, dry cough, fatigue, chest pain or choking sensation (with no associated respiratory distress), myalgia, anosmia, ageusia or gastro-intestinal symptoms.\n3. Patients with pulse oximetry arterial saturation (SpO2) \u2265 92 % on room air at\nenrolment.\n4. Patients with the following hematological and biochemical laboratory parameters obtained within 7 days prior to D0:\n\u2022 Hemoglobin > 9.0 g dL-1\n\u2022 Absolute Neutrophil Count \u2265 1000 mm-3;\n\u2022 Platelets \u2265 100,000 mm-3;\n\u2022 Creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL min-1 by the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n\u2022 Total serum bilirubin < 2 x ULN\n\u2022 Alkaline phosphatase< 2 x ULN, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) < 3 x ULN;\n5. Women of childbearing potential and men receiving the study treatment and their partners must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method during the study and for 6 months (180 days) after end of study or early termination. Contraception should be in place at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Women must be surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential must use a highly effective contraceptive method. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will enter the study after confirmed menstrual period and a negative pregnancy test. Highly effective methods of contraception include true abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD) or hormonal contraception aiming at inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner. True abstinence is defined when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. In each case of delayed menstrual period (over one month between menstruation) confirmation of absence of pregnancy is required. This recommendation also applies to WOCBP with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycle. Female and male patients must not be planning pregnancy during the trial and for 6 months post completion of their participation in the trial. In addition, male patients should use condom during the trial and for 6 months (180 days) post completion of their participation in the study. Male patients must not donate sperm as long as contraception is required. For the purpose of this protocol, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a\npost-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Finally a man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.\n6. Patients must understand, sign and date the written voluntary informed consent form at the visit prior to any protocol-specific procedures.\n7. Patients able and willing to comply with study visits and procedures as per protocol.\n8. Patients should be affiliated to a social security regimen (for French sites only).",
      "E.4 Principal exclusion criteria": "Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will be excluded from the study:\n1.\tPatients with moderate or severe acute respiratory failure or requiring non-invasive ventilation or oxygen or with SpO2 < 92% or tachypnea (respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths/min).\n2. Patients treated with immunosuppressors and/or immunomodulators (cf. Appendix #2).\n3. Engrafted patients (organ and/or hematopoietic stem cells).\n4. Patients with uncontrolled auto-immune disease.\n5. Patients with known or suspected active (i.e. not controlled) bacterial, viral\n(excluding COVID-19) or fungal infections.\n6. Patients with preexisting, severe and not controlled organ failure.\n7. History or active malignancy requiring chemotherapy or radiation therapy (excluding 2 years disease free survivor patients).\n8. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.\n9.

The subject must also have been off any anti-CMV treatment between the current and prior infection. Otherwise, the current infection may be considered continuation of the prior infection.\n4. Require ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir administration for conditions other than CMV when study treatment is initiated (example: herpes simplex virus [HSV] co-infection requiring use of any of these agents after the randomization) or would need a co-administration with maribavir for CMV infection.\n5. Be receiving leflunomide, letermovir, or artesunate when study treatment is initiated. NOTE: Subjects who may be receiving leflunomide must discontinue the use at least 14 days prior to randomization at Visit 2/Day 0 and the first dose of study treatment. Subjects receiving letermovir must discontinue use 3 days prior to first dose of study treatment. Subjects receiving artesunate must discontinue the use prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n6. Be on treatment with anti-CMV agents (ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir) for the current CMV infection for longer than 72 hours.\n7. Have known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to an excipient of the study treatments.\n8. Have severe vomiting, diarrhea, or other severe gastrointestinal illness within 24 hours prior to the first dose of study treatment that would preclude administration of oral medication.\n9. Require mechanical ventilation or vasopressors for hemodynamic support at the time of randomization.\n10. Be female and pregnant or nursing.\n11. Have previously completed, discontinued, or have been withdrawn from this study.\n12. Have received any investigational agent with known anti-CMV activity within 30 days before initiation of\nstudy treatment or CMV vaccine at any time.\n13. Have received any unapproved agent or device within 30 days before initiation of study treatment.\n14. Have any clinically significant medical or surgical condition that, in the investigator\u2019s opinion, could interfere with interpretation of study results, contraindicate the administration of the assigned study treatment, or compromise the safety or well-being of the subject.\n15. Have previously received maribavir.\n16. Have serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening, or serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >5 times ULN at screening, or total bilirubin \u22653.0 x ULN at screening (except for documented Gilbert\u2019s syndrome), as analyzed by local or central lab.\n17. Have known (previously documented) positive results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Subjects must have a confirmed negative HIV test result within 3 months of study entry or, if unavailable, be tested by a local laboratory during the screening period.\n18. Have active malignancy with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer, as determined by the investigator. Subjects who experience relapse or progression of their underlying malignancy (for which HSCT was performed), as determined by the investigator, are not to be enrolled.\n19.
