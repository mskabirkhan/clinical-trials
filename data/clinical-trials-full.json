Other higher levels of oxygen support (including higher doses of oxygen, non-invasive respiratory support (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), high-flow nasal oxygen, or bi-level non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)) and invasive mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube can all be included, but patients are excluded if they have received >72 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation during their current illness.\n \n***De-escalation of respiratory support is defined as a significant reduction in respiratory support that maintains saturation within the treating physicians\u2019 target range within 24 hours of inclusion to this study. A significant reduction is any change in mode of oxygen delivery (i.e. intubated to non-invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation to standard oxygen therapy, or reduction of standard \u201cwall\u201d oxygen of more than 3 litres / min). Changes less than this will not be considered to be significant. \n \nAdditional Inclusion Criteria for the Physiological Sub-Study\n\u2022 Arterial line in place for clinical care\n\u2022 Receiving either non-invasive respiratory support or invasive mechanical ventilation for which the inspired oxygen fraction can be measured.",

Residents, health care workers in such facilities, and other staff of such facilities are eligible under this criterion. For participants entering the study from these settings, \u201cpotential exposure to a specific identified individual with laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection\" is defined to mean the occurrence of SARS-COV-2 infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in another resident of the facility or in a staff member of the facility. \uf02d\n-Industrial settings shown to have been at high risk for SARS-COV-2 transmission, including but not limited to meatpacking plants. Workers in such facilities are eligible under this criterion. \uf02d -Military settings including but not limited to barracks, ships, or other close-quarters working environments. Military and civilian personnel exposed in such settings are eligible. \uf02d \n-Health care facilities. Health care workers and other staff exposed in such setting are eligible under this criterion. \uf02d \n-University or college dormitories. Students exposed in such setting are eligible. \uf02d \nHousehold contacts. Any adult living in the same household as an index case are eligible under this criterion. \uf02d \n-Other settings of similar close or high-density inter-personal proximity. The potential for exposure in such settings may be assessed on a case-by-case basis by investigators. Individuals exposed in such settings are eligible under this criterion. \n3. Prior to enrollment, participants must not have had COVID-19 symptoms, as described in Table 7 in protocol, within 10 days of dosing. \n4. Negative result from point of care SARS-CoV-2 serology testing at screening.\n5. Contraceptive use by men or women: \na. Male Participants: Contraception for male participants is not required, however, to avoid the transfer of any fluids, all male participants must use a condom from Day1 and agree to continue through365 days following administration of the IMP. \nb. Female Participants \n-Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomization without an alternative medical cause. The following age specific requirements apply: \no Women < 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range. \no Women \u226550 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment. \n- Female participants of childbearing potential must use one highly effective form of birth control. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must agree to use one highly effective method of birth control, as defined below, from Day1 and agree to continue through 365 days following administration of the IMP. Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together. All women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at Visit 1 and throughout the study as indicated per the SoA.\n6. Able to understand and comply with study requirements/procedures (if applicable, with assistance by caregiver, surrogate, or legally authorized representative)based on the assessment of the investigator. \n7.

Defined as previous history of severe adverse event or serious adverse event after receiving any approved vaccine.\n(b) Increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as those whose locations or circumstances put them at appreciable risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, based on available risk assessment at time of enrollment. Examples include:\no Health care workers, including staff of long-term care facilities (including skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and independent living facilities for senior adults)\no Workers in industrial settings shown to have been at high risk for SARS-COV-2 transmission, including but not limited to meatpacking plants\no Military personnel residing or working in high density settings including but not limited to barracks, ships, or close-quarters working environments\no Students living in dormitory settings\no Others living in settings of similar close or high-density proximity\n3. Medically stable defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 1 month prior to enrollment, with no acute change in condition at the time of study enrollment as judged by the investigator.\n4. Negative result from point of care SARS-CoV-2 serology resting at screening.\n5. Contraceptive use by men or women:\n(a) Male Participants: Contraception for male participants is not required, however, to avoid the transfer of any fluids, all male participants must use a condom from Day 1 and agree to continue through 365 days following administration of the IMP.\n(b) Female Participants:\n-Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomization without an alternative medical cause. The following agespecific requirements apply:\no Women < 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range.\no Women \u2265 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment.\n- Female participants of childbearing potential must use one highly effective form of birth control. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must agree to use one highly effective method of birth control, as defined in the protocol from Day 1 and agree to continue through 365 days following administration of the IMP. Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together. All women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at Visit 1 and throughout the study as indicated per the SoA\n6. Able to understand and comply with study requirements/procedures (if applicable, with assistance by caregiver, surrogate, or legally authorized representative) based on the assessment of the investigator.\n7.

History of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\n4. Known history of allergy or reaction to any component of the study drug formulation.\n5. Previous hypersensitivity, infusion-related reaction, or severe adverse reaction following administration of a mAb.\n6. Any prior receipt of investigational or licensed vaccine or other mAb/biologic indicated for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 or expected receipt during the period of study follow-up.\n7. Clinically significant bleeding disorder (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or platelet disorder), or prior history of significant bleeding or bruising following IM injections or venepuncture.\n8. Any other significant disease, disorder, or finding that may significantly increase the risk to the participant because of participation in the study, affect the ability of the participant to participate in the study, or impair interpretation of the study data.\n9. Receipt of blood products or immunoglobulins, including mAbs, within 6 months, or 5 antibody half-lives if longer than 6 months, prior to screening\n10. Receipt of any IMP in the preceding 90 days or expected receipt of IMP during the period of study follow-up, or concurrent participation in another interventional study\n11. For women only - currently pregnant (confirmed with positive pregnancy test) or breast feeding.\n12.

Adult (\u2265 18 years old) men or women hospitalized or not hospitalized, diagnosed\nfor SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR (within 48 hours prior to randomization), with at least one associated risk factor. Considered risk factors are:\n\u2022 Age \u2265 65 years\n\u2022 Obesity defined as BMI \u2265 30\n\u2022 Recent history of uncontrolled High Blood Pressure (SBP > 150 mm Hg & DBP >100 mm Hg) according to investigator\n\u2022 Treated diabetes (type I or II)\n\u2022 History of ischemic cardiovascular disease \n2. Symptomatic patients must present at least 1 of the following symptoms at enrollment: fever or perceived fever (for more than 24 hours, headache, sore throat, dry cough, fatigue, chest pain or choking sensation (with no associated respiratory distress), myalgia, anosmia, ageusia or gastro-intestinal symptoms.\n3. Patients with pulse oximetry arterial saturation (SpO2) \u2265 92 % on room air at\nenrolment.\n4.

Women of childbearing potential and men receiving the study treatment and their partners must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method during the study and for 6 months (180 days) after end of study or early termination. Contraception should be in place at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Women must be surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential must use a highly effective contraceptive method. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will enter the study after confirmed menstrual period and a negative pregnancy test. Highly effective methods of contraception include true abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD) or hormonal contraception aiming at inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner. True abstinence is defined when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. In each case of delayed menstrual period (over one month between menstruation) confirmation of absence of pregnancy is required. This recommendation also applies to WOCBP with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycle. Female and male patients must not be planning pregnancy during the trial and for 6 months post completion of their participation in the trial. In addition, male patients should use condom during the trial and for 6 months (180 days) post completion of their participation in the study. Male patients must not donate sperm as long as contraception is required. For the purpose of this protocol, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a\npost-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Finally a man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.\n6. Patients must understand, sign and date the written voluntary informed consent form at the visit prior to any protocol-specific procedures.\n7. Patients able and willing to comply with study visits and procedures as per protocol.\n8. Patients should be affiliated to a social security regimen (for French sites only).",
